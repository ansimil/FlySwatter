### About

As part of the first project (week 3) during the Ironhack bootcamp I was tasked will builing a game using JS, HTML, CSS and the p5 library. 

I decided to try and recreate one of my favourite games as a kid - Fly Swatter from the first Mario Paint for SNES. 

The goal of the game is swat the flies that appear on the screen. The speed of the fly's movements increases with each new fly.
